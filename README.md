> ### "*AI is awesome, but we need to give it arms and legs.*"

👋 Hi, I’m Paul ([@happycod3r](https://www.github.com/happycod3r))

👀 I'm interested in [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development), [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory), [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics  ), [Space science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_space_science), [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and science in general.
I also love to produce electonic music, but my greatest passion is software development. I am an okay web developer, but
I am way better at developing desktop stuff and utilities, mostly because I love implementing the logic.

😍 What I **love** is to come up with new Ideas. I love coding, my dog and cats, summer and I also love
to produce Hardstyle/Hard Trance music.

😡 What I **hate** is how quick time passes when your having fun, and leaving things unfinished!

✨ The Languages I know are `C++`, `C++/CLR`, `Python`, `JavaScript`, `PHP`, Shell scripting (`Sh`, `Zsh`, `Ps1`), `HTML`, `CSS`, `Less`, `XML`, `JSON`, `Markdown`, & `Liquid`.

🌱 I’m currently learning [Liquid Template Language](), [advanced Python](), [Next.js](), the [YouTube Data API v3](), [Google Cloud Development](),
and a little about [AI](), [Large Language Models]() and the [OpenAI API]().

💞️ I’m not particularly looking to collaborate on anything really, but I'm always down for a project! I'm constantly creating and finishing projects,
so it would be cool to contribute to something I didn't come up with for a change. I could use the professional experience. So feel 
free to hit me up

📫 How to reach me is easy. Just use any of my social links anytime and as soon as I get the notification I'll get back to 
you for sure.
