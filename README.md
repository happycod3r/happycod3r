> ### "*AI is awesome, but we need to give it arms and legs.*"

👋 Hi, I’m Paul ([@happycod3r](https://www.github.com/happycod3r))

👀 I'm interested in [software development](), [number theory](), [particle physics](), [space](), [computer science]() and science in general.
I also love to produce electonic music, but my greatest passion is software development. I am an okay web developer, but
I am way better at developing desktop stuff and utilities, mostly because I love implementing the logic.

😍 What I **love** is to come up with new Ideas. I love coding, my dog and cats and I also love
to produce Hardstyle/Hard Trance music.

😡 What I **hate** is how quick time passes when your having fun, and leaving things unfinished!

✨ The Languages I know are [C++](), [C++/CLR](), [Python](), [JavaScript](), [PHP](), Shell scripting ([Sh](), [Zsh](), [Ps1]()), [HTML](), [CSS](), [Less](), [XML](), [JSON](), [Markdown](), & [Liquid]().

🌱 I’m currently learning [Liquid Template Language](), [advanced Python](), [Next.js](), the [YouTube Data API v3](), [Google Cloud Development](),
and a little about [AI](), [Large Language Models]() and the OpenAI API]().

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. I'm always down for a project! I'm constantly creating and finishing projects,
so it would be cool to contribute to something I didn't come up with for a change. I could use the professional experience.

📫 How to reach me is easy. Just use any of my social links anytime and as soon as I get the notification I'll get back to 
you for sure.
