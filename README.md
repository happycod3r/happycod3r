> ### "*AI is awesome, but we need to give it arms and legs.*"

👋 **Hi, I’m** Paul ([@happycod3r](https://www.github.com/happycod3r))

😄 Pronouns: he/him

👀 **I'm interested in** [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development), [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory), [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics  ), [Space science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_space_science), [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and science in general.
I also love to produce electonic music, but my greatest passion is software development. I am an okay web developer, but
I am way better at developing desktop stuff and utilities, mostly because I love implementing the logic.

😍 **What I love** is to come up with new Ideas. I love coding, my dog and cats, summer and I also love
to produce Hardstyle/Hard Trance music.

😡 **What I hate** is how quick time passes when your having fun, and leaving things unfinished!

⚡ **The Languages I know are** `C++`, `C++/CLR`, `Python`, `JavaScript`, `PHP`, Shell scripting (`Sh`, `Zsh`, `Ps1`), `HTML`, `CSS`, `Less`, `XML`, `JSON`, `Markdown`, & `Liquid`.

⚡ **I’m currently learning** [Liquid Template Language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), [Next.js](), the [YouTube Data API v3](), [Google Cloud Development](), and a little about [AI](), [Large Language Models]() and the [OpenAI API](). I'm also always trying to advance in the languages I know or have used before too.

⚡ **I'm looking to collaborate on**  I'm not partial to anything really, but what I would like to collaborate on is something for the desktop. I'm good at implementing logic and GUIs.

📫 **How to reach me** is easy. Just use any of my social links to the left ⬅ under my profile picture. I'm availabe just reach out!
